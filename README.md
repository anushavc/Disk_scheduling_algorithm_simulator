# Disk scheduling algorithm simulator

This is a simulator for three disk scheduling algorithms algorithms (SCAN,SSTF and FCFS).

## Features
* The simulator can generate the chart which depicts the sequence in which the requests have been serviced using the respective algorithm. 
* The simulator also has a recommender feature which suggest the algorithm having the shortest total seek time for a given requests list.
